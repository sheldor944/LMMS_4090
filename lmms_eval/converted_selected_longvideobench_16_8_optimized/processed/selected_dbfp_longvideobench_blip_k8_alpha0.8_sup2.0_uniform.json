      "First appears the scene of a projector screen with a white background and black figures, showing an elderly man in a black suit with a red tie positioned at the top right. Then, the video shows a wine-red background wall projecting a white screen, with an empty stage in the middle and a woman speaking on the right, and an audience seated below. Finally, a blonde woman in a black suit looking at a computer screen and speaking, set against a wine-red wall corner appears."
