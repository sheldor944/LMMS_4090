    "options": [
      "A. Because his training primarily revolves around developing skills for basketball that emphasizes vertical leap and technique over linear speed, resulting in less dedicated practice for pure sprinting performance.",

      "C. His genetic makeup predisposes him to slower twitch muscle fibers, inherently limiting his top speed potential.",
      "D. Because his training prioritizes football skills rather than pure speed, leading to a disparity in specialized speed training routines."
